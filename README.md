# Tic Tac Toe Game in C

A simple console-based **two-player X-O game** written in C.  
This was my **first C programming project**, and I created it to practice fundamental concepts like arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## 🧩 Features
- Menu at the start (Start Game / Exit)
- Replay option after each game
- Score counter for Player X and Player O
- Easy-to-use console interface

## 📁 File
- `code.c` – Main source code file containing the complete game logic

## 🚀 How to Run

You can compile and run the program using any C compiler (e.g., GCC).

### Using GCC (Linux/Windows)
```bash
gcc code.c -o tictactoe
./tictactoe
